## [0.0.18] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **UIAudit** — a vision-free UI linter that reports layout problems from the UI's own metrics
  (rects, text sizes) so an agent or test can catch them without a screenshot. Adds
  `Runtime/UIAudit/` (`com.Lautaro-Arino.Laubrary.UIAudit`, namespace `Laubrary.UIAudit`) with a
  section architecture: a **uGUI** section (Canvas/RectTransform/TMP — off-screen, text overflow,
  tiny text, list-needs-scroll) and an **IMGUI** section that lints ZuiRuntime-drawn immediate-mode
  UI. Menu under **Laubrary ▸ UI Audit**; entry point `UIAudit.Report()` / `UIAudit.Run()`.
- **ZuiRuntime draw recording (`ZuiAudit`)** — immediate mode has no retained tree, so ZuiRuntime
  now records one frame of its draws (double-buffered, zero cost when off) and the UIAudit IMGUI
  section lints that record for tiny text, text overflow, and off-screen elements. `ZuiStack` gains
  a `LabelIn` escape hatch (explicit-rect text, recorded so misuse is caught).

## [0.0.17] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **ZuiRuntime** — the runtime sibling of the editor ZUI toolkit: trap-aware immediate-mode
  (OnGUI) UI helpers for prototypes, adopted from TrueEye's nucleus and grown in ClaudeUI. Adds
  `Runtime/ZuiRuntime/` (`com.Lautaro-Arino.Laubrary.ZuiRuntime`, namespace `ZuiRuntime`, pure
  UnityEngine): `Zui` fill/contrast primitives, `UIScale` (one crisp font-based scaling rule),
  cached scaled styles, `ZuiStack` (text measured before drawn — labels cannot clip; button rows
  share one baseline), screen-clamped anchored panels, keyed scroll-stacks that auto-scroll when
  content outgrows the box, tint scopes, `ZuiOverlay` hotkey-overlay base, and the **XYAB gamepad
  face-button visualiser** (`FaceButtons` + `ControllerColors`) for gamepad games.
  ⚠ Projects carrying a vendored `Assets/ZUI/Scripts/Runtime/ZuiRuntime*` copy (TrueEye, ClaudeUI)
  must delete it when updating Laubrary, or the duplicate types collide.

## [0.0.16] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **Zoetrope** — a new tool for authoring versioned 2D characters/animations (a *Zoe*) from
  sprite sheets, extracted from the retired AssetScavenge project. Adds `Runtime/Zoetrope/`
  (`com.Lautaro-Arino.Laubrary.Zoetrope`) and `Editor/Zoetrope/`
  (`com.Lautaro-Arino.Laubrary.Zoetrope.Editor`), including the Zoe Browser, Animation Builder,
  atlas baking, pixel-accurate meta-layer collision, and an Aseprite import/round-trip pipeline.
  Zoes are authored into the host project's `Assets/Zoetrope/…`; the package ships zero assets.

### Dependencies
- Added `com.unity.2d.sprite` and `com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json` (required by Zoetrope).
